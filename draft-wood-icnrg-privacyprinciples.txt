1.  Introduction

   RFC6973 [RFC6973] outlines major security and privacy threats and
   countermeasures for networking protocols.  It identifies and
   describes several attacks which can be carried out against users,
   including correlation, identification, secondary use (of personal or
   private information), unauthorized or oblivious disclosure, and user
   exclusion.  We refer the reader to [RFC6973] for more details about
   these threats.

   The authors of this document believe that the ICNRG should share the
   view of the IP community which states that passive and pervasive
   observation and surveillance is an attack on individuals'
   communication [RFC7285].  Consequently, the ICNRG should strive to
   meet or exceed the privacy protections driven by the IETF.  Moreover,
   privacy preserving mechanisms should evolve as Internet security
   threats and standards change.  This means that ICN should always use
   best practices for protecting the privacy of individuals.

   To be specific, ICN communication should use, by default, best
   practice cryptographic methods to ensure privacy and confidentiality.
   Presently, this means that all communication should be protected by
   forward-secure encryption.  We therefore claim that the mechanism to
   bootstrap this type of communication should be a native part of ICN
   rather than add-on protocols analogous to (D)TLS.

   In this document we outline several principles for private
   communication in ICN based on accepted best practices to prevent or
   deter the aforementioned threats.  We do not specify mechanisms to
   satisfy these principles since that is still an open topic of
   research in the field.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Privacy Notions

   Privacy has no clear definition.  Rather, as RFC6973 [RFC6973]
   describes, it is a spectrum of different threats against a user and
   their data.  This document describes several notions of privacy with
   respect to specific threats, e.g., information disclosure and
   correlation.  If we are to outline privacy principles for ICN then we
   must too have similar notions of privacy.  To that end, the following
   list enumerates and describes types of privacy with which we are
   concerned.

   1.  Data privacy: application data in an ICN message, e.g., the
       content object payload, is not disclosed or leaked to
       unauthorized persons.

   2.  Transport privacy: the entire contents of an ICN message are not
       disclosed or leaked to forwarders (i.e., this information is only
       visible to the consumer and producer).

   3.  Request (lookup) privacy: ICN _requests_ are not disclosed or
       leaked to anyone but the originator of the request.

   4.  Application privacy: Information about an application is not
       leaked to unauthorized persons through network activity.

3.  A Catalog of Privacy-Sensitive Information

   In this section we begin an enumeration of privacy-related
   information that should be considered in the context of our
   principles (detailed in the following section).

   o  User- or -host-identifying information.

      Examples include user names, account names (or numbers), email
      addresses, source or location information, long-lived key names,
      certificates, or certificate names.

   o  Application-specific information.

      This includes any information beyond what is necessary to route
      traffic for a particular application between parties involved.

   o  Information shared across users.

      Examples include common group keys or content object names.

   o  Metadata collected from network traffic.

      Examples include packet headers and timing information.

4.  ICN Privacy Principles

   This section outlines a proposed set of privacy principles for ICN
   architectures.  These are inspired by recent activities in the IETF
   to prevent attacks such as mass surveillance in a plethora of
   Internet protocols, e.g., DNS and TCP.  These principles are intended
   to be necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for data, transport,
   and application privacy.

   1.  All ICN messages should be encrypted by default.

       *  Rationale: Cleartext communication is not best practice.

   2.  The privacy of ICN messages should rely on forward-secure keys.

       *  Rationale: Privacy mechanisms based on long-lived key pairs
          are not forward-secure, i.e., they are not secure if the
          private key is compromised.  Moreover, long-lived key pairs
          can be traced to individuals and can lead to correlation and
          other information leakage in requests and responses.  Neither
          of these are considered best practice.

   3.  ICN messages should not reveal information about the data
       exchanged or entities involved in the production or consumption
       of data beyond what can be learned from their relative location
       in the network.

       *  Rationale: Minimize information leakage and linkage between
          packets and entities involved in their transport.  Moreover,
          this is to prevent revealing information about the parties
          involved in a data exchange through their names.

   4.  Clients should always authenticate an endpoint to which personal
       identification information is sent.

       *  Rationale: Privacy-sensitive information should never be
          disclosed to an endpoint (e.g., a router or producer
          application) that is not authenticated.

   5.  Application data contained in an ICN message should only be
       viewable by authenticated and authorized parties.

       *  Rationale: Applications should not rely on network or link-
          layer encryption for protection since the network cannot be

          trusted.  End-to-end encryption between the client and
          endpoint serving content is best practice.

   6.  Where authentication of clients by servers is necessary (e.g.,
       for access control), per-application credentials should be used.

       *  Rationale: Compromised user credentials for one application
          does not compromise other applications or services.

5.  Privacy in Practice

   In this section we describe the practical implications that come from
   implementing the privacy principles outlined in the previous section.

   1.  If encryption is enabled by default then only the users who
       possess the keys are able to view or consume the data.  This
       restricts the benefits of caching to those consumers who are in
       possession of the correct key(s).  For example, a content may be
       encrypted such that only a subset of users of a particular
       application can access it.

   2.  There must be some negotiation between endpoints transferring
       data, whether the endpoint is a producer or replica.  This
       negotiation must use fresh randomness to create forward-secure
       keys used to encrypt the traffic.  A native protocol must exist
       to accomplish this negotiation as a prelude and necessary
       requirement to exchange any application data.

   3.  Application information must be contained inside an envelope
       protected using some form of encryption that satisfies the
       property #2.  This does not mean that content objects cannot
       carry signatures or public keys, for example.  It simply means
       that such information must not be exposed in the clear as it
       moves through the network.

   4.  Clients should never send application data to an entity or
       endpoint which has not been authenticated.  Session negotiation
       should allow endpoint (and in some cases mutual) authentication.

   5.  The observable contents of a message convey no application
       information.  This means that names no longer refer to objects
       but rather to services from which content can be produced.  This
       is analogous to the TLS+TCP/IP model wherein encrypted packets
       are sent between a client and some producer POP or CDN.  All
       application data is contained in an encrypted envelope.

   6.  User credentials should not be used across applications.  Every
       consumer should possess and employ a unique set of credentials
       for every application they use.
